to change the background color of your sketch you should
call the background() function

the background function needs 3 arguments discribing the r g b values
of the color you want to be your background.

the r, g and b values are numbers between 0 and 255
so if u want no green-ness and alot of blue-ness in your background color
you want your g value to be 0 and your b value to be 255

example:
if u want a nice cyan background color you should do:
`background(36, 120, 255)`

if you have moving objects in your sketch you most likely want to put it in the
draw function to keep refreshing the background

if nothing will move in your sketch at all, you most likely want to put the
background function in the setup function to fully optimise the performance of
the sketch
