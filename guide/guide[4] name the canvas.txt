the title of the sketch is most likely displayed in the bar at the top
of the application when you run it. this can be different depending on your OS

to set the title of the sketch just call the rename() function wich accepts a 
string representing the title

for example if you want the sketch title to be `game`, you should do:
`rename("game")`

note: the "" are verry important scince it indicates that the argument
is indeed a string

note 2: you most likely want to put the rename function in the setup function
to prevent performance issues
