to begin creating your first sketch (a ezpg project) follow these steps:

-first ofcourse make sure u have python installed from this link:
https://www.python.org/

-create your python file wich will contain your code
this can be called anything what u want as long as it ends
with .py

-open your newly made "sketch" file inside any text editor
(this can be notepad, or word but I really recommend to download
a text editor wich is made to edit code documents like sublime text,
visual studio code, notepad++, vim etc)

-now you must import the ezpg module, to do this simply type "import ezpg"
inside of your sketch (if this doesnt work, make sure you have the ezpg.py file
included in the same folder as your sketch ya dummy) the ezpg.py file can be found
in the root of this repo or in the demos folder

-gg! now u have excess to every ezpg function available. now u should create 2
functions called setup and draw, so now you should have this code:
-----------------------------
import ezpy

def setup:
	pass

def draw:
	pass
-----------------------------

now as last line we must give the functions we made too the ezpy module and it will
handle all the executions of the functions by itself!

to do this use the "start" function and give your setup function as first argument
and your draw function as second argument.

so now this should be your final code:
-----------------------------
import ezpy

def setup:
	pass

def draw:
	pass

start(setup, draw)
-----------------------------

note: this code will not beable to run because there was no canvas created. to
create a canvas look at guide[3]
