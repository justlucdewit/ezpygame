welcome to ezpg and thank you for downloading
if, you dont know what ezpg is. its a python module writen by luc de wit
its based on a verry popular, already existing module called pygame

pygame is a python module wich can be used to create window applications/
games. however its required to know alot of python/programming functionality
like:
-for loops
-if statements
-functions
-variables

hence it can be a little overwhelming for beginners.
ezpg is focesed on simplifing python app development for beginners
and advanced programmers so you can create a fast and simple simulation/
game/visualization. all u have to do is call a couple of functions
from within the setup and draw function (if u dont understand what that is,
look in sketch.py and look at some demos in the demos folder)

the concept is based on the java/javascript libraries: processing and p5.js:
