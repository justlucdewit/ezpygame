to create a canvas you must use the createCanvas() function.
this will most likely have to be called in the your setup function.

it requires 2 arguments describing the width and height of the screen
so if you want a 1000x700 canvas you should call `createCanvas(1000, 700)`
INSIDE THE SETUP FUNCTION
